19/3: 
Test to run the simulation using server set up in university.
- Topology graphml design to fit ot exp setup in lab. -DOne
- Flow adjustment to follow the trace. _ Know how to DOne
- Services configuration. Not yet.
-> Outcome: finish and run 1 episode represent 1 simulation day.
Just use the env test.

20/3: 
Create the csv
- Add 4 services in abc.yaml file -> not yet
- Change and add flow -> come up with plan to get a full flow and place it in the network. -> not yet

21/3: 
Draw all the environment functions.
Finish/ understand the apply function in simulation wrapper,
come up with plan to implement OMNET++ here!!!

22/3: 
Still need to plan the whole classes for simulator and everything. !!!

23/3: 
Build the Network simulator and make it run !!!

rlsp cmd: 
rlsp res/config/agent/sample_agent.yaml res/networks/tue_network.graphml res/service_functions/tue_abc.yaml res/config/simulator/test.yaml res/service_functions/sfc_requirement.yaml 200 --append-test

DDPG LEarn resource: 
https://www.alexirpan.com/2018/02/14/rl-hard.html

7/4: 
Test with 1000 time steps / episode
node cap = 10, link cap = 10.

8/4:
Change the node cap to 100, link cap to 100.
Add the writter schedule.
Change the noise to increase the exploration to overcome the local minimal. 
Test with 100 time steps / episode.

11/4:
Tool to foreseen how to trainning going? 
- Tensor board & call back

Change the require service latency to be more strict -
Increase the exploration to explore more !!! 
Test w 100 time steps / episode first. 

12/4: 
Write the DDPG using baseline 
Test with TD3 using baseline and compare result.

18/4: 
Export the file and run on the server edge 2 and 3 to save time.

13/6: 
9h15: 
- Agent: DDPG baseline with the set up of DDPG 
- Network: Triangle network.
- Service :1 service
To enable several services: 
    change the index in wrapper env + writter file in simulation
- Objectiive weight: 50-50
-> test to see if the agent can learn and provide good result.

After that -> run with real implementation in metro network.
